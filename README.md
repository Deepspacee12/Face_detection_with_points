# Face_detection_with_points
this is a simple code i wrote using vison_cascade fuction in matlab 
this is the starting of my computer vison journy and what got me into it 
my fav project till date. 
What this code basically does is that it detects a face in the live facecam video and draws a box arround it while ploting points on it
it is a matlab code file so that is what you would need to  run this file
